Project no: 6

Project due date: Dec. 5th , 2018

Project description: (Also, what image did you draw?)
	- i am trying to make a sort of recreation of the battle scenes from the gameboy advance game series
		Advance wars, in which the player is tasked with defending an objective for about 2-3 minutes or until
		they defeat the enemy commander

Where I got my sprites:

	I downloaded all of my sprites and back grounds from the internet:
	-	https://www.spriters-resource.com/ds_dsi/advancewarsds/sheet/33991/
	-  http://z3.invisionfree.com/The_Sprite_Hub/ar/t40.htm
	I got my sound effects from your examples and the back ground music from 
	 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdovwIohtfM&list=PLbZvcJcTGa9_bKPhqV15xWHjaBSSvddgb&index=3



How many backgrounds do I have:
 	i have 2 backgrounds 

The easiest part of this project:
	- I would say not giving up, because it was fun to do.


Problems that I had in completing this project:
	- I couldn't get the AI to act like i wanted so i had to implement multiplayer instead

Final Project:
	- my project is a reimagining of the game series advance wars, letting two players
		go head to head. The rules are simple, the first player to destroy the other player's
		 home base wins
